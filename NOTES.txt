Setup Vector Data base
    Using ChromaDb
    1. Fast search
    2. Help stored things in optimal way (Optimize Storage)
    word and sentence convert to ---> Vector
    stored in let say SQL --> hashing function is apllied --> grouped the similar vectors
    new vector come for search --> hashing is apply to it --> we know which group to look --> linear search in that group only and not in whole db --> fast computing (less computing)
    This is called 'Local Sensity Hashing'
