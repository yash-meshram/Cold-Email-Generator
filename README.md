# Cold Email Generator

## Overview

**Cold Email Generator** is an AI-powered application that automates the process of generating personalized cold emails for job applications. By leveraging advanced language models and vector databases, the app extracts job postings from career pages, matches your portfolio projects to required skills, and crafts tailored cold emails to maximize your outreach effectiveness.

> **Note:** This project uses the [Llama 3 8B Instant](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) model (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) via Groq for all language generation and understanding tasks.

## Model Details

- **LLM Used:** [Llama 3 8B Instant](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`)
- **Provider:** [Groq](https://console.groq.com/)
- The model is accessed through the `langchain_groq` integration in the code (see `chains.py`).

## Features

- **Automated Web Scraping:** Extracts job postings from provided URLs.
- **AI-Powered Email Generation:** Uses LLMs (via LangChain and Groq) to generate personalized cold emails.
- **Portfolio Matching:** Matches your portfolio projects to job requirements using a vector database (ChromaDB).
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly web interface for input and results.
- **Customizable:** Easily update your portfolio and adapt to different job postings.

## How It Works

1. **Input a Job URL:** Enter the URL of a job posting or career page.
2. **Web Data Extraction:** The app scrapes and cleans the job data.
3. **Job Parsing:** Extracts structured job information (role, company, skills, etc.).
4. **Portfolio Query:** Finds your most relevant projects based on required skills.
5. **Cold Email Generation:** Crafts a personalized email referencing your experience and portfolio.
6. **Output:** The generated email is displayed for review and use.
